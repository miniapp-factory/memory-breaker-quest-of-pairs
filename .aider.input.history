+Title: Memory Breaker: Quest of Pairs
+
+Description:
+A cozy, story-based memory-matching game featuring soft pastel, hand-drawn chibi animals in 2D. Players travel through themed realms while matching cards, unlocking power-ups, and progressing through a gentle narrative. Inspired by Animal Crossing and Tsuki Odyssey.
+
+Art Style:
+
+Soft pastel colors (seafoam, dusty rose, peach, turquoise)
+
+Chibi animals in cute job outfits (bellhop, sailor, chef)
+
+Thick outlines, simple shapes, low-stimulus look
+
+Cozy, calming, hand-drawn aesthetic
+
+Optional pixel-like low-res version
+
+Core Gameplay:
+Players flip cards to find matching pairs. Completing all pairs clears the level. Grid size and difficulty increase each level. Timers scale with difficulty.
+
+Story Mode:
+Short, charming narration per level—light, cozy, not too long. Players travel through themed realms: Meadow → Forest → Frozen Peak → Volcano → Final Boss Realm.
+
+Power-Up Cards (activate only when matched):
+
+Reveal All: briefly reveals entire board
+
+Freeze Time: stops timer
+
+Double Points: next match gives bonus
+
+Shuffle Board: reshuffles remaining cards
+(No random triggers; must be earned.)
+
+Special Features:
+
+Difficulty-based timers
+
+Combo scoring system
+
+Haptic feedback on successful matches
+
+Soft music + gentle SFX
+
+Auto-save with localStorage
+
+No automatic shuffle (only power-up triggers)
+
+Boss Level:
+Final realm includes:
+
+Scrambling AI that disrupts the board
+
+Faster timer
+
+Boss-only special tiles
+
+“Stun the boss” using matched power-up cards
+
+Goal:
+Complete all realms and defeat the final boss to restore harmony to the Memory Realms.
