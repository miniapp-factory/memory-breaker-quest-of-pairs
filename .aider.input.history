+Create a web-based mini app called *Memory Breaker: Soft Match Edition*, a simple and relaxing memory-matching game with a soft pastel interface and clean, minimal card designs. The app should start with a main menu that includes a *Start Game* button and a *Continue* button that appears only if saved progress exists using localStorage. When the game begins, display a grid of face-down cards that flip when the player taps them. The player flips two cards at a time; if the cards match, they stay revealed, and if they do not match, they automatically flip back after a short delay. Each level should gently increase difficulty by slightly expanding the card grid and reducing the available timer. During gameplay, always show the *timer*, *score*, *pause button*, and the interactive *card grid*. The scoring system should be simple: award points for every match and give a small bonus for finishing before the timer ends. The game should automatically save the player’s level and score so they can continue later. Use soft flip animations, light sound effects, and simple chibi-style or shape-based card icons. Controls must remain extremely simple, relying only on single tap/click to flip cards, with no power-ups, no boss stages, and no advanced mechanics—just a clean, easy-to-play memory game.
