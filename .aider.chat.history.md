Title: Memory Breaker: Quest of Pairs

Description:
A cozy, story-based memory-matching game featuring soft pastel, hand-drawn chibi animals in 2D. Players travel through themed realms while matching cards, unlocking power-ups, and progressing through a gentle narrative. Inspired by Animal Crossing and Tsuki Odyssey.

Art Style:

Soft pastel colors (seafoam, dusty rose, peach, turquoise)

Chibi animals in cute job outfits (bellhop, sailor, chef)

Thick outlines, simple shapes, low-stimulus look

Cozy, calming, hand-drawn aesthetic

Optional pixel-like low-res version

Core Gameplay:
Players flip cards to find matching pairs. Completing all pairs clears the level. Grid size and difficulty increase each level. Timers scale with difficulty.

Story Mode:
Short, charming narration per level—light, cozy, not too long. Players travel through themed realms: Meadow → Forest → Frozen Peak → Volcano → Final Boss Realm.

Power-Up Cards (activate only when matched):

Reveal All: briefly reveals entire board

Freeze Time: stops timer

Double Points: next match gives bonus

Shuffle Board: reshuffles remaining cards
(No random triggers; must be earned.)

Special Features:

Difficulty-based timers

Combo scoring system

Haptic feedback on successful matches

Soft music + gentle SFX

Auto-save with localStorage

No automatic shuffle (only power-up triggers)

Boss Level:
Final realm includes:

Scrambling AI that disrupts the board

Faster timer

Boss-only special tiles

“Stun the boss” using matched power-up cards

Goal:
Complete all realms and defeat the final boss to restore harmony to the Memory Realms.

The changes you need to make are in the following files:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` exported values.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create this file to describe the logo image that should be generated.  

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
