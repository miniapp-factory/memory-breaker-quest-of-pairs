Title: Memory Breaker: Quest of Pairs

Description:
A cozy, story-based memory-matching game featuring soft pastel, hand-drawn chibi animals in 2D. Players travel through themed realms while matching cards, unlocking power-ups, and progressing through a gentle narrative. Inspired by Animal Crossing and Tsuki Odyssey.

Art Style:

Soft pastel colors (seafoam, dusty rose, peach, turquoise)

Chibi animals in cute job outfits (bellhop, sailor, chef)

Thick outlines, simple shapes, low-stimulus look

Cozy, calming, hand-drawn aesthetic

Optional pixel-like low-res version

Core Gameplay:
Players flip cards to find matching pairs. Completing all pairs clears the level. Grid size and difficulty increase each level. Timers scale with difficulty.

Story Mode:
Short, charming narration per level—light, cozy, not too long. Players travel through themed realms: Meadow → Forest → Frozen Peak → Volcano → Final Boss Realm.

Power-Up Cards (activate only when matched):

Reveal All: briefly reveals entire board

Freeze Time: stops timer

Double Points: next match gives bonus

Shuffle Board: reshuffles remaining cards
(No random triggers; must be earned.)

Special Features:

Difficulty-based timers

Combo scoring system

Haptic feedback on successful matches

Soft music + gentle SFX

Auto-save with localStorage

No automatic shuffle (only power-up triggers)

Boss Level:
Final realm includes:

Scrambling AI that disrupts the board

Faster timer

Boss-only special tiles

“Stun the boss” using matched power-up cards

Goal:
Complete all realms and defeat the final boss to restore harmony to the Memory Realms.

The game must include a main menu with a Start Game button, gameplay screen with clickable cards, increasing difficulty, power-ups, story narration, and a final boss level.

🎨 Art & Visual Style Requirements

Soft pastel palette (seafoam, dusty rose, peach, soft turquoise)

2D hand-drawn chibi animals in job outfits (bellhop, sailor, chef, etc.)

Thick outlines, round/simple shapes

Low-stimulus, cozy atmosphere

Animated card flips (simple fade/rotate)

Soft UI buttons with rounded corners

🏠 Main Menu Requirements

Game title: Memory Breaker: Quest of Pairs

Short subtitle description

A Play Game button that starts Story Mode

A Pixel Mode Toggle (optional aesthetic switch)

A Continue button (if localStorage save exists)

When the user presses Play Game, load Level 1.

🕹 Core Gameplay Requirements

The game must include:

1. Clickable Cards

Display a grid of face-down cards

When the user clicks a card → it flips to reveal its art

Clicking a second card reveals it

If they match → remove them or mark them as cleared

If they don’t match → flip both back over

Smooth, cozy flipping animation

2. Card Themes

Each realm uses a different set of chibi animal cards to match:

Meadow: rabbits, cats, birds

Forest: bears, squirrels, foxes

Frozen Peak: penguins, seals, snow bunnies

Volcano: fire spirits, dragon cubs

Final Boss Realm: corrupted chibi animals and boss tiles

📖 Story Mode Requirements

Each level begins with one short narration line from a cute chibi guide.
Tone must be calm, cozy, not long.

Example:
"The Meadow spirits are cheering for you! Match the pairs and restore balance."

Realms in order:

Meadow

Forest

Frozen Peak

Volcano

Final Boss Realm

Unlock next realm only after completing the previous one.

📈 Difficulty Scaling

Forest	3×4 → 4×4	Shorter
Frozen Peak	4×4 → 4×5	Faster
Volcano	4×5 → 5×6	Fast
Boss	5×6	Very fast + special rules

Timer speeds up per realm.
Optional vibration on card match (haptic feedback).

🔮 Power-Up Cards (Triggered Only When Matched)

Power-ups appear rarely in the grid as special pair types.
They must not activate randomly, only when the matching pair is clicked.

Power-ups include:

1. Reveal All

Reveals the whole board for 2–3 seconds

2. Freeze Time

Pauses timer temporarily

3. Double Points

Next match gives bonus score

4. Shuffle Board

Shuffles ONLY the remaining cards (never automatic)

Power-up cards are visually distinct with glowing pastel borders.

⭐ Feedback & Atmosphere

Gentle sound effects when flipping and matching

Haptic vibration on correct matches

Combo system: consecutive quick matches increase score

Calm animations (glow on match, soft pop sound)

💾 Saving Progress

Pixel-mode setting

Story progress

On return, show a Continue button.

🔥 Boss Level Requirements

The Final Boss Realm includes:

Faster timer

Boss-only tiles

A scrambling AI that periodically shuffles (only in boss level)

Power-ups can stun the boss (pause scrambling for a short time)

Player wins by clearing all pairs under pressure

Boss must have a special intro line and ending dialogue.

🧩 UI Layout Requirements
During Gameplay:

Timer bar or countdown

Current score

Combo indicator

Pause button

Grid of clickable cards

Subtle background decorations based on the realm theme
